# weatherwebapp
A Weather Web App giving the weather in any location. I used two APIs to help me carry this out, DARK SKY and the MAPBOX APIs. The website is in a REST API format where the requests for the weather are obtained from a REST API made from combining relevant data from the two APIs.To access this part of the website add (/weather?address=  ), followed by the location you want to check the weather in to have access to the websites RESTful state.
