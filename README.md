# weatherwebapp
A Weather Web App giving the weather in any location. I used two APIs to help me carry this out, DARK SKY and the MAPBOX APIs.There is a seperate part of the website to resolve get requests. To access this part of the website add (/weather?address=  ), followed by the location you want to check the weather.
The webapp can be found at http://solo-weather-webapp.herokuapp.com/
